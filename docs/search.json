It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices.1 Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.\n⋆Why is mental health important?\nMental Health is important because it can sometimes have an effect on our physical health as well.\n⋆Can your mental health change over time?\nYes, it’s important to remember that a person’s mental health can change over time, depending on many factors. When the demands placed on a person exceed their resources and coping abilities, their mental health could be impacted. For example, if someone is working long hours, caring for a relative, or experiencing economic hardship, they may experience poor mental health.\n⋆What causes mental illness?\nThere is no single cause for mental illness. A number of factors can contribute to risk for mental illness, such as\n-Adverse Childhood Experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse (for example, child abuse, sexual assault, witnessing violence, etc.)\n-Experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes\n-Biological factors or chemical imbalances in the brain\n-Use of alcohol or drugs\n-Having feelings of loneliness or isolation\n\n\n\n",
